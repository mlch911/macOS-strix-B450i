Tested with macOS 11.2.1 - later versions have not been tested. This EFI isn't guaranteed to work flawlessly with your hardware... but it can be used as a starting point to aid getting your hackintosh up and running. Feel free to join my Telegram [channel](https://t.me/macOSstrixB450i).

You will need to [flush a new SMBIOS](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide/AMD/zen.html#platforminfo) if you want to use iCloud services. The included SMBIOS has been blacklisted and may result in a suspended iCloud account if you choose to use it.

If you're able to, please consider [donating to AMD OSX.](https://forum.amd-osx.com/index.php?dbtech-donate/drives/amd-os-x.1/donate) Without the team, this fun project wouldn't be possible!
